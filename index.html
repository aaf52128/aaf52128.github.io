    <p> A sometimes forgotten player for the Brooklyn Nets, <span style="color:white;font-weight:bold">
    Caris Lavert </span>
    will be a key factor if the Nets wish to upset the Philadelphia
    76ers in the first round. After averaging 13.7 points, 3.9 assists,
    and 3.8 rebounds in his shortened regular season run, Lavert will 
    have to contribute more on the offensive side of the ball to take
    some pressure off D'angelo Russell in this series.

     <p> After missing the Boston Celtics playoff run last season,
     <span style="color:white;font-weight:bold"> Kyrie Irving </span>
     will be making his first playoff appearance wearing green            
     and white. Last season, Boston advanced to the Eastern Conference
     Finals where they were met by Lebron James and defeated in Game
     Seven. However, amid a load of contreversy this season, Kyrie
     will look to lead this team of young, talented players to the 
     NBA Finals for the first time in ten seasons. The Boston faithful
     has a lot to be excited about this postseason with a lot of action
     packed basketball looming in the next few months.
